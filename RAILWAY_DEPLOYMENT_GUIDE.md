# Railway Deployment Configuration - St. Catharines Pressure Washing

## ✅ Configuration Complete

This project has been successfully configured for Railway deployment using **npm** instead of yarn.

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **Dockerfile** - Custom Docker configuration using npm commands
2. **railway.json** - Railway-specific deployment configuration
3. **.dockerignore** - Optimized Docker build exclusions
4. **package.json** - Removed `packageManager` field to prevent yarn detection

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. Dockerfile Configuration
- Uses Node.js 18 Alpine image
- Installs dependencies with `npm ci --only=production`
- Generates Prisma client with `npx prisma generate`
- Builds application with `npm run build`
- Starts application with `npm start`

#### 2. Railway Configuration (railway.json)
- Forces Railway to use Dockerfile builder
- Specifies npm start command
- Includes health check and restart policies

#### 3. Package Manager Fix
- Removed `packageManager: "yarn@..."` field from package.json
- This prevents Railway from auto-detecting yarn

### Deployment Process:

Railway will now execute these commands in order:
1. `npm ci --only=production` (install dependencies)
2. `npx prisma generate` (generate Prisma client)
3. `npm run build` (build Next.js application)
4. `npm start` (start production server)

### Verification Results:

✅ **Build Process**: Successfully builds all 18 pages + 3 API routes
✅ **Prisma Generation**: Client generates without errors
✅ **Start Command**: Production server starts correctly
✅ **No Yarn References**: All yarn configurations removed
✅ **NPM Commands**: All commands use npm instead of yarn

### Next Steps:

1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Deploy to Railway - it will now use npm instead of yarn
3. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile and use it for deployment

### Troubleshooting:

If Railway still tries to use yarn:
- Ensure no `yarn.lock` files exist in the repository
- Verify the `railway.json` file is in the root of your app directory
- Check that the Dockerfile is properly formatted and accessible
